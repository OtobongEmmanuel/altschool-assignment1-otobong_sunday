    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Otobong Emmanuel Sunday. I hold a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Architecture and have worked 
        on several architectural projects. This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, 
        and ability to learn quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, my interest shifted toward technology, especially cloud computing. I became curious about how the internet 
        works and started learning about cloud infrastructure. Despite challenges, I pursued self-learning and built a basic 
        understanding of cloud services and recently gained admission to study Cloud Engineering with AltSchool Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m now focused on becoming a cloud engineer, with a goal to build scalable solutions that empower communities and 
        businesses. I believe technology has the power to drive positive change, and I’m excited to be part of that journey.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
    <p>
        I joined this program to make a meaningful shift into cloud engineering, an area of technology that has always fascinated 
        me. After years in architecture, I realized I wanted to work in a field where I could build not just physical structures, 
        but also digital systems that connect people and power innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cloud engineering stood out to me because of its global impact. It enables access to tools and opportunities regardless of 
        location, and I want to be part of the force behind that access. This program offers the structure, mentorship, and practical 
        experience I need to grow into a confident and capable cloud engineer.
    </p><br>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>
        My primary goal is to become a skilled and certified cloud engineer with real-world experience. I aim to work on impactful 
        projects that solve problems and improve access to technology for businesses and communities. I plan to pursue certifications, 
        such as the 
        <ul>
            <li>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, </li>
            <li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect and </li>
            <li>AWS Certified DevOps Engineer, </li>
        </ul>  
        to strengthen my expertise and industry readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the long term, I hope to build solutions that create opportunities for others, especially young people looking to start careers 
        in technology. I also plan to give back by promoting tech awareness and mentoring others who are just starting their journey.
